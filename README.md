# GitHub Action to sync directories to Object Storage Buckets ðŸ”„

This simple action uses the [rclone CLI](https://rclone.org/s3/) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote Object Storage bucket. Previously it used the AWS S3 CLI, however since version `2.0.0` this has been replaced with rclone.


## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

It is also possible to add your own required args for `rclone sync`, including [S3 specific](https://rclone.org/s3/) args for rclone.

#### The following example includes optimal defaults for a public static website:

- `--s3-acl public-read` makes your files publicly readable.
- `--links` won't hurt and fixes some weird symbolic link problems that may come up.
- Most importantly, take note of the default behaviour of `rclone sync`, as it for example deletes any files from the destination which no longer present on the source. This may or may not be what you intend.
- **Optional tip:** If you're uploading the root of your repository, adding `--exclude '.git/*'` prevents your `.git` folder from syncing, which would expose your source code history if your project is closed-source. (To exclude more than one pattern, you must have one `--exclude` flag per exclusion. The single quotes are also important!)

```yaml
name: Upload Website

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: FugaCloud/s3-sync-action@2.0.0
      with:
        args: --s3-acl public-read -v --links
      env:
        ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.CYSO_CLOUD_AMS_OBJECT_STORAGE_KEY_ID }}
        SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYSO_CLOUD_AMS_OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET }}
        ENDPOINT: https://core.fuga.cloud:8080
        BUCKET: "staticsites"
        REGION: "ams"
        SOURCE_DIR: 'build'
        DEST_DIR: 'mywebsite'
```


### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€”Â otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.

| Key | Value | Suggested Type | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your Access Key ID. [More info here.](https://docs.cyso.cloud/object-storage/getting-started/#using-the-dashboard) | `secret env` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your Secret Access Key. [More info here.](https://docs.cyso.cloud/object-storage/getting-started/#using-the-dashboard) | `secret env` | **Yes** | N/A |
| `BUCKET` | The name of the bucket you're syncing to. For example, `eu-west-1` or `fra`. | `env` | No | N/A |
| `REGION` | The region where you created your bucket. Not set by default. | `env` | No | N/A |
| `ENDPOINT` | The endpoint URL of the bucket you're syncing to. For example for region Frankfurt of Cyso Cloud this is `https://fra.fuga.cloud:8080`. | `env` | No | Defaults to AWS |
| `SOURCE_DIR` | The local directory (or file) you wish to sync/upload to the bucket. For example, `public`. Defaults to the current working dir. | `env` | No | `./` |
| `DEST_DIR` | The directory inside of the bucket you wish to sync/upload to. For example, `my_project/assets`. Defaults to the root of the bucket. | `env` | No | `/` (root of bucket) |
